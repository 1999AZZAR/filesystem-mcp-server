Hello from the FileSystem MCP Server!
This is a test file to demonstrate our new MCP server capabilities.
We have 18 powerful tools for file system management.

Features include:
- File operations (read, write, copy, move, delete)
- Directory management (create, list, find files)
- Advanced operations (search, watch, compare, archive)
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

Let's test some of these tools!
